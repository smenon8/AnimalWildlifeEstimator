 <h3> Creating a photo album</h3>
  <p><b>Background:</b></p>
  <p> We are a research group working on a project to count and track threatened and endangered animals through publicly shared social media photos. </p> 
  <p>Having accurate information about wildlife populations is critical to protecting them and conserving their habitats.</p>  
  <p>Gathering accurate information from public social media reports would make it possible to collect up-to-date information about wildlife more broadly than otherwise possible and help conservation efforts.</p>
  <p>As part of this research, we must understand what kinds of animal photos people are likely to share (and not share) with their friends.</p>
  
  <p><b>This HIT:</b></p> 
  <p>In this HIT,we will first ask 2 questions about your photo-sharing habits, and then we will show you a number of nature photos a person took while on vacation in Africa.</p> 
  
  <p>Please imagine that these are <em>your own photos</em> that you have taken and tell us which of these photos you would share or not share on social media. </p>
  
  <p> Thank you for your help</p>
